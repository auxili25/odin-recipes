    Burgers have long been a staple food in our family. So I guess you can say we are a typical American family</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>500 g ground beef</li>
    <li>2 strips of bacon, diced</li>
    <li>1 cup white onion cut into slices</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
    <li>6 pieces of hamburger buns cut into halves</li>
    <li>1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>6 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>6 slices of tomato</li>
    <li>1 lettuce</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Season the meat with 1 tablespoon of MAGGI® Naturísimo Seasoning and the Worcestershire sauce. Add the bacon, mix well and divide the meat into six portions. Form balls and flatten them into a hamburger shape</li>
    <li>On a lightly oiled grill, sear the meat and cook over indirect heat on both sides. Booking.</li>
    <li>In a frying pan, heat the onion, water and sugar. Cook until caramelized, remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>Separately mix the mayonnaise and 1 tablespoon of MAGGI® Naturísimo Seasoning. Prepare the burgers as usual with the rest of the ingredients. Serve with the onion, the reserved mayonnaise and the amount of lettuce leaves of your preference.</li>
    <li>Remove from the grill, cool and enjoy your Beef Burgers, with the unique flavor of MAGGI® Naturísimo Seasoning.</li>
